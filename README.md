# Image Captioning using EfficientNet and Transformer
Implemented on COCO 2014 dataset: https://cocodataset.org/#download

Used EfficientNet to extract features from the images and Transformer(Decoder) to generate the captions.
As for EfficientNet, I slightly modified this tensorflow implementation code: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet


Here's the architecture. It's pretty simple and intuitive.
